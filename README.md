# Go LeetCode Solutions

This is a Go project where I solve problems from LeetCode using the Go programming language. The project is structured to include solutions for various LeetCode problems, organized in a clear and maintainable way.

## LeetCode Profile

You can find my LeetCode profile here: [etharrra](https://leetcode.com/u/etharrra/).

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

### `solutions/`

This directory contains the Go files for each LeetCode problem I've solved. Each file corresponds to a specific problem and includes the solution code.

### `utils/`

This directory contains utility files that define common data structures like `ListNode` and `TreeNode`, which are frequently used in LeetCode problems.

### `main.go`

This is the entry point of the project. It can be used to test or demonstrate the solutions.

### `go.mod`

This file defines the Go module and its dependencies.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/etharrra/go-leetcode.git
    cd go-leetcode
    ```

2.  **Run a specific solution:**
    You can run any of the solution files by calling the function name in main function. For example:

    ```go
    func main() {
    	s := "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
    	fmt.Println(solutions.IsPalindrome(s))
    }
    ```

    And the run the command

    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

3.  **Add new solutions:**
    To add a new solution, create a new Go file in the `solutions/` directory and implement the solution there. You can use the existing files as a reference.

4.  **Test your solutions:**
    You can write tests for your solutions using Go's testing framework. Create a `_test.go` file for each solution and write test cases.
