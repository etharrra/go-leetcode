Let’s walk through the corrected implementation of `hasPathSum` step by step with the given binary tree `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`. Here's the visualization of the binary tree:

```
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \   / \
   4   5 6   7
  /
 8
```

Assume the `targetSum` is 15. We will trace the code execution.

### **Key Concepts in the Code**

-   **Stack**: Used to store the nodes and their running path sum as we traverse the tree.
-   **DFS Traversal**: The algorithm performs a Depth-First Search, visiting each node, and backtracking when reaching leaf nodes.
-   **Path Sum**: Calculated dynamically by adding the value of the current node to the running sum.

---

### **Execution Steps**

#### Initialization

1. Start with `root = 1`. Push the root onto the stack:
    ```go
    stack = [{node: 1, sum: 1}]
    ```

---

#### Step 1: Process Node 1

1. Pop from the stack:

    ```go
    current = {node: 1, sum: 1}
    stack = []
    ```

2. Node `1` is not a leaf, so push its children onto the stack with updated sums:

    - Right child `3` → Running sum: `1 + 3 = 4`
    - Left child `2` → Running sum: `1 + 2 = 3`

    Stack becomes:

    ```go
    stack = [{node: 3, sum: 4}, {node: 2, sum: 3}]
    ```

---

#### Step 2: Process Node 2

1. Pop from the stack:

    ```go
    current = {node: 2, sum: 3}
    stack = [{node: 3, sum: 4}]
    ```

2. Node `2` is not a leaf, so push its children onto the stack:

    - Right child `5` → Running sum: `3 + 5 = 8`
    - Left child `4` → Running sum: `3 + 4 = 7`

    Stack becomes:

    ```go
    stack = [{node: 3, sum: 4}, {node: 5, sum: 8}, {node: 4, sum: 7}]
    ```

---

#### Step 3: Process Node 4

1. Pop from the stack:

    ```go
    current = {node: 4, sum: 7}
    stack = [{node: 3, sum: 4}, {node: 5, sum: 8}]
    ```

2. Node `4` is not a leaf, so push its left child onto the stack:

    - Left child `8` → Running sum: `7 + 8 = 15`

    Stack becomes:

    ```go
    stack = [{node: 3, sum: 4}, {node: 5, sum: 8}, {node: 8, sum: 15}]
    ```

---

#### Step 4: Process Node 8 (Leaf)

1. Pop from the stack:

    ```go
    current = {node: 8, sum: 15}
    stack = [{node: 3, sum: 4}, {node: 5, sum: 8}]
    ```

2. Node `8` is a leaf, and the running sum is `15`, which matches the `targetSum`. Return `true`.

---

### **Remaining Nodes**

If the target sum wasn't found, the algorithm would continue processing the remaining nodes (`5`, `3`, `6`, `7`) similarly until all paths were checked.

---

### **Code Behavior Summary**

1. **Stack Usage**: Tracks the nodes and their running sums as we traverse the tree.
2. **DFS Traversal**: Ensures all root-to-leaf paths are checked.
3. **Leaf Node Check**: For every leaf node, the algorithm compares the running sum to `targetSum`.
4. **Early Exit**: Returns `true` as soon as a matching path is found.

---

### **Final Output**

For the given tree `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` with `targetSum = 15`, the algorithm correctly identifies the path `[1, 2, 4, 8]` and returns `true`.
